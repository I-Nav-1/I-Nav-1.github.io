    <h2>What is IAM?</h2>
    <p>
      Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a critical component of modern IT security. It ensures that the right individuals have access to the right resources at the right times for the right reasons. IAM encompasses policies, processes, and technologies that manage user identities and regulate access to systems and data.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Features of IAM:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Authentication and Authorization</li>
      <li>Access Control Policies</li>
      <li>Single Sign-On (SSO)</li>
      <li>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</li>
      <li>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      IAM is essential for protecting sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulations, and improving operational efficiency.

    <h3>Identity and Access Management (IAM)</h3>
    <p>
        In India, IAM practices align with the security guidelines established by CERT-In (Computer Emergency Response Team â€“ India), which operates under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). These guidelines emphasize adherence to international standards such as ISO/IEC 27001, which provides a framework for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving information security management systems (ISMS).Implementing IAM in accordance with CERT-In and ISO 27001 standards is essential for protecting sensitive data, ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements, and improving operational efficiency.
